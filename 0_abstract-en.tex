Topological quantum computing is an approach to the problem of implementing
quantum gates accurately and robustly. The idea is to exploit topological
properties of certain quasiparticles called anyons to obtain a proposed
implementation of quantum computing which is inherently fault-tolerant. The
mathematical structure that describes anyons is that of modular tensor
categories. These modular tensor categories can be constructed from the
representations of certain algebraic objects called quantum groups. In this
thesis give an explanation of modular tensor categories and quantum groups as
they relate to topological quantum computing. It is intended that it can be
read with some basic knowledge of algebra and category theory.  The hope is to
give a concrete account accessible to computer
scientists of the theory of modular tensor categories obtained from quantum
groups. The emphasis is on the category theoretic and algebraic point of view
rather than on the physical point of view.
