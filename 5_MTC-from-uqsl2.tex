We will denote the category of representations of $U_z^{res}(\mathfrak{g})$ at a
$\ell^\text{th}$ root of unity $z$ by $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{g}, \ell)$. We
know that $\mathcal{C}(\sll(2), \ell)$ is a rigid monoidal category since
$U_z^{res}(\frakg)$ is a Hopf algebra. $\mathcal{C}(\sll(2), \ell)$ is also
braided. However, we saw in \ref{RepTheoryofResSL2} that $\mathcal{C}(\sll(2),
\ell)$ is not semisimple: the Weyl modules $W_z^{res}(n)$ are not in general
completely reducible. The same is true in $\mathcal{C}(\frakg, \ell)$.  We will
discuss in this section how to obtain a modular tensor category from
$\mathcal{C}(\frakg, \ell)$. this category's simple objects will be our anyons,
and each such category is a topological quantum computing theory. 
\todo{Why is it a Hopf algebra? Show this somewhere.}



\section{Quantum trace}

The Hopf algebra structure on $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$, coupled with the $R$-matrix,
gives the category of representations $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{g}, \ell)$ the
structure of a ribbon category. There is therefore a well-defined trace of an
endomorphism in the category. This is distinct from the usual trace of an
vector space endomorphism. 

We will denote the trace of a morphism $f$ by $\tr_q(f)$.

In the case $U_q(\sll(2))$, the quantum trace is given by 

\begin{equation}
    \tr_q(f) = \tr(Kf)
\end{equation}

where $\tr$ is the usual trace of a vector space endomorphism.

\section{Negligible morphisms}
\todo{ sort out which things should be theorems and which things should be lemmas}
To make this subcategory into a modular tensor categories, we will need to
quotient this category by the modules with quantum dimension zero. This is a
fairly natural thing to do.  \todo{ why, really?}

\begin{defn}
    A morphism $f: T_1 \to T_2$ is \emph{negligible} if $\tr_q(fg) = 0$ for any $g: T_2 \to T_1$
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
    A module $T$ is \emph{negligible} if all of its endomorphisms are negligible.
\end{defn}
\section{Tilting modules} 
% when citing, say something like: originally done by Anderson & P, there's
% something more accessible by Sawin


\todo{ define Weyl modules}
\begin{defn}
    Suppose $M$ is a $U_q(\sll(2))$-module. A \emph{Weyl filtration} for $M$
    is a sequence of submodules 

    \begin{equation}
        \left\{ 0 \right\} = J_0 \subset \cdots \subset J_n = M
    \end{equation}

    such each $J_k$ is a maximal submodule of $J_{k+1}$ and each quotient $J_{k+1}/J_k$ is a Weyl module. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    A $U_q(\sll(2))$-module $M$ is called \emph{tilting} if both $M$ and $M^*$ have Weyl filtrations.
\end{defn}

The following proposition lists some properties of tilting modules which will
be important.

\begin{prop}
\begin{enumerate}
    \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\roman{enumi})}
    \item The dual of any tilting module is tilting.
    \item The direct sum of two tilting modules is tilting
    \item Any direct summand of a tilting module is tilting
    \item The tensor product of two tilting modules is tilting
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

We can therefore restrict our attention to the indecomposable tilting modules.
The indecomposable tilting modules for $U_z^{Res}$ are indexed by integers $n
\geq 0$. The tilting module $T_z(n)$ can be described explicitly as follows.

$T_z(n)$ has basis $\left\{ t_0, \ldots, t_n \right\} \bigcup \left\{ t'_0,
    \ldots, t'_{r} \right\}$, where $r = 2\ell - 2 - n$, and the following
    action:

\begin{align*}
    Kt_i &= z^{n-2i} t_i \\
    X^+ t_i &= [n-i+1]_z t_{i-1} \\
    (X^+)^{(\ell)} t_i &= ( (n-i)_1) + 1) t_{i-\ell} \\
    X^-t_i &= [i+1]_z t_{i+1} \\
    (X^-)^{(\ell)} t_i &= ( i_1 + 1) t_{i+\ell} \\
    Kt'_i &= z^{r-2i} t'_i \\
    X^+ t'_i &= [r-i+1]_z t'_{i-1}  + \dbinom{n + i - \ell}{i}_z t_{n+i-\ell} &\text{ for $0 < i \leq r$}\\
    X^+ t'_0 &= [n - \ell + 1]_z t_{n-\ell} \\
    X^-t'_i &= [i+1]_z t'_{i+1} &\text{ for $0 \leq i < r$}\\
    X^- t'_r &= \dbinom{\ell - 1}{n - \ell + 1}_z t_\ell \\
    (X^\pm)^{(\ell)} t'_i  &= 0
\end{align*}

\section{Construction of the MTC}
\label{MTC-construction}

We construct the modular tensor category that we will use to do topological
computing by restricting our attention to the subcategory of tilting modules of
$U_q(\mathfrak{g})$, and quotienting by the negligible morphisms. We can do
this because the hom sets $Hom(V,W)$ are vector spaces:

\todo{ change the notation here, I guess}
\begin{defn}
    Define the category $\mathcal{C}^\text{int}$ be the category with objects tilting modules and morphisms 

    \begin{equation*}
        \Hom(V,W) = \Hom_T(V,W) / \text{negligible morphisms}
    \end{equation*}

\end{defn}

The category $\mathcal{C}^\text{int}$ has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item An object $T$ is negligible if and only if it is isomorphic to 0 in $\mathcal{C}^\text{int}$
    \item  $\mathcal{C}^\text{int}$ is a ribbon category
    \item Any object $T$ in $\mathcal{C}^\text{int}$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of Weyl modules.
    \item $\mathcal{C}^\text{int}$ is a semisimple abelian category. 
    \item $\dim_{\mathcal{C}^\text{int}} T > 0$ for every $T \not\simeq 0$
\end{enumerate}

$\mathcal{C}^\text{int}$ is in fact a modular tensor category. A proof of this
can be found in \cite{Kirillov} 
 
\section{Fusion rules}

The fusion rules for $U_q(\sll(2))$ are given by 

\todo{ notation is inconsistent here}
\begin{equation}
    V_m \otimes V_n \simeq \sum_i N_{mn}^i V_i
\end{equation}

where 

\begin{equation}
    N_{mn}^i = \begin{cases} 1 \text{ for } |m-n| \leq i \leq m+n, i \leq 2k - (m+n), i + m + n \in 2 \mathbf{Z} \\
                             0 \text{ else } 
               \end{cases}
\end{equation}
