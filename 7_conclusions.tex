We have given an account of the theory of modular tensor categories arising
from quantum groups as they relate to topological quantum computing. We
conclude with some discussion about possible future work. 

This investigation started because we were interested in using facts about
specific representations of $B_n$ that arise in the modular tensor categories
that we've discussed to better compile quantum gates into braids.
       
One interesting question that is so far unanswered is that of whether there are
entangling leakage-free 2-qubit gates in universal TQC models. The work in
\cite{Ainsworth2011} shows us that it is impossible for all gates to be
leakage-free, but the possibility of there being some nontrivial group of such
leakage-free is not excluded. 

All of the strategies for finding single-qubit gates discussed in the previous
section involve a significant amount of brute-force search. It would be
interesting to see if this can be avoided or improved by using facts about
braid group representations: \cite{Burrello2011} and \cite{Burrello2010} refer
to results on random matrix theory to support conjectures about the proposed
algorithms, but do not use any facts about braid group representations as
\cite{Ainsworth2011} does.
