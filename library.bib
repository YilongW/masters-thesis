abstract = {The intimate connection between q-deformed Heisenberg uncertainty relation and the Jackson derivative based on q-basic numbers has been noted in the literature. The purpose of this work is to establish this connection in a clear and self-consistent formulation and to show explicitly how the Jackson derivative arises naturally. We utilize a holomorphic representation to arrive at the correct algebra to describe q-deformed bosons. We investigate the algebra of q-fermions and point out how different it is from the theory of q-bosons. We show that the holomorphic representation for q-fermions is indeed feasible in the framework of the theory of generalized fermions. We also examine several different q-algebras in the context of the modified Heisenberg equation of motion.},

These three-braids can then be efficiently compiled and improved to any required accuracy using the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm.},

@book{Hall2003,
abstract = {This book addresses Lie groups, Lie algebras, and representation theory. In order to keep the prerequisites to a minimum, the author restricts attention to matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. This approach keeps the discussion concrete, allows the reader to get to the heart of the subject quickly, and covers all of the most interesting examples. The book also introduces the often-intimidating machinery of roots and the Weyl group in a gradual way, using examples and representation theory as motivation. The text is divided into two parts. The first covers Lie groups and Lie algebras and the relationship between them, along with basic representation theory. The second part covers the theory of semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras, beginning with a detailed analysis of the representations of SU(3). The author illustrates the general theory with numerous images pertaining to Lie algebras of rank two and rank three, including images of root systems, lattices of dominant integral weights, and weight diagrams. This book is sure to become a standard textbook for graduate students in mathematics and physics with little or no prior exposure to Lie theory.

@article{Hong2008,
abstract = {It has been conjectured that every \$(2+1)\$-TQFT is a Chern-Simons-Witten (CSW) theory labelled by a pair \$(G,\backslash lambda)\$, where \$G\$ is a compact Lie group, and \$\backslash lambda \backslash in H\^{}4(BG;Z)\$ a cohomology class. We study two TQFTs constructed from Jones' subfactor theory which are believed to be counterexamples to this conjecture: one is the quantum double of the even sectors of the \$E\_6\$ subfactor, and the other is the quantum double of the even sectors of the Haagerup subfactor. We cannot prove mathematically that the two TQFTs are indeed counterexamples because CSW TQFTs, while physically defined, are not yet mathematically constructed for every pair \$(G,\backslash lambda)\$. The cases that are constructed mathematically include: 1. \$G\$ is a finite group--the Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFTs; 2. \$G\$ is torus \$T\^{}n\$; 3. \$G\$ is a connected semi-simple Lie group--the Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFTs. We prove that the two TQFTs are not among those mathematically constructed TQFTs or their direct products. Both TQFTs are of the Turaev-Viro type: quantum doubles of spherical tensor categories. We further prove that neither TQFT is a quantum double of a braided fusion category, and give evidence that neither is an orbifold or coset of TQFTs above. Moreover, representation of the braid groups from the half \$E\_6\$ TQFT can be used to build universal topological quantum computers, and the same is expected for the Haagerup case.},
