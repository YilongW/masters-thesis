\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are Weyl modules and tilting modules.
\item The quantum trace and an explicit formula for it in
  $\mathcal{R}ep_fU_q(\mathfrak{sl}(2))$.
\item What are negligible morphisms?
\item How one gets an MTC by looking at the subcategory of tilting modules
  and quotienting by negligibility.  Proofs?
\item Making the above construction as explicit as possible in
  $\mathcal{R}ep_fU_q(\mathfrak{sl}(2))$.
\item Make Bonesteel's arguments about the braiding equivalence of $V_0$
  and $V_3$ rigourous, as well as $V_1$ and $V_2$ of course.
\end{enumerate}
