Firstly, I thank my awesome advisor Prakash Panangaden for introducing me to
topological quantum computing, always providing guidance when I got lost, and
for cooking some excellent meals.

I thank all of my amazing professors at McGill, in particular Patrick
Hayden for first getting me excited about quantum computing.  

Thanks to the Quantum Group at Oxford University for their hospitality during
my visit to Oxford and many useful discussions.

I thank all of my friends for their support and company. In particular I'd like
to thank Rebecca Brunswick and Kamal Marhubi. I also thank Alex Lang for
reading this thesis and offering many useful comments and corrections, and
Andrew Stacey, for writing and providing some much-needed help with the braids
package I used to draw braid diagrams.  Finally, I thank my parents, for always
encouraging me in my studies. 


Pursuing this degree was possible thanks to scholarships from NSERC and FQRNT.
