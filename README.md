The Algebra of Topological Quantum Computing
============================================


This is my master's thesis, on the algebra of topological quantum computing.

If you like, you can [download the pdf](https://github.com/jvns/masters-thesis/raw/master/thesis.pdf).

It is likely to be impenetrable unless you too are trying to understand 
anyons, quantum groups, and modular tensor categories.
