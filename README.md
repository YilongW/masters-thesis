The Algebra of Topological Quantum Computing
============================================

<img src="http://jvns.ca/images/thesis-picture.png">

This is my master's thesis, on the algebra of topological quantum computing.

You can [download the pdf](https://github.com/jvns/masters-thesis/raw/master/thesis.pdf).

It is likely to be impenetrable unless you too are trying to understand 
anyons, quantum groups, and modular tensor categories. 

Even then it is probably impenetrable, actually.
