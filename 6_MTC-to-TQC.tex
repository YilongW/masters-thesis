In this chapter, we explain the relationship between TQC and modular tensor
categories arising from quantum groups. We will focus mainly on the category
$\Fib$ of Fibonacci anyons, which is the simplest MTC which is universal for
quantum computing. 

We will introduce $\Fib$ and discuss in some detail how to simulate the quantum
circuit model in $\Fib$. We will then discuss Hormozi's constructions of a
universal gate set for quantum computing in $\Fib$. We will also discuss
Rowell's classification of MTCs of small order and state a conjecture of
Rowell's about universality in MTCs.

\section{The Fibonacci anyon}
The simplest universal model of TQC, and so a good candidate for implementing TQC, is the Fibonacci anyon. Here we introduce the Fibonacci anyon
and explain how to simulate quantum circuits using Fibonacci anyons.

The category $\Fib$ of Fibonacci anyons is a modular tensor category which is a
subcategory of $\mathcal{C}^{int}(\sll(2),5)$: its objects are representations
of $U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$ for $z$ a $5^{th}$ root of unity. The simple objects in 
$\Fib$ are $V_0, V_2$. We will refer to them as $\one$ and $\tau$
respectively, $\one$ being the tensor unit and trivial anyon type. The
fusion rules in $\Fib$ can be computed easily and are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\tau \odot \tau = I \oplus \tau$
    \item $\tau \odot I = \tau$
    \item $I \odot I = I$
\end{itemize}
Recall that the $\oplus$ here means that when $\tau$, $\tau$ fuse, the result
is a superposition of anyons of type $1$ and $\tau$.  The reason they are
called Fibonacci anyons is that $\tau^{\odot n} \simeq F_{n-1} \one \oplus F_{n+2}
\tau$, where $F_n$ is the $n^{th}$ Fibonacci number.

We will now explain a simple way to simulate quantum circuits using Fibonacci
anyons. To simulate quantum circuits, we need

\begin{itemize}
\item Qubits
\item Systems of multiple qubits
\item A way to do measurement
\item Unitary gates
\item A universal gate set
\end{itemize}

First we construct qubits. Consider a triplet $(\tau,\tau,\tau)$ of Fibonacci
anyons. A simple computation shows that 

\begin{equation}
(\tau \odot \tau) \odot \tau \simeq 2\tau \oplus 1
\end{equation}

This means that there are $3$ fusion possibilities for $3$ anyons with type $\tau$:

\fusiondiagram{\tau}{\one}
\fusiondiagram{\tau}{\tau}
\end{center}

Two of them have the final result $\tau$. We use this fact to define our qubits
to be triplets of $\tau$ anyons with total charge $\tau$. We saw in
\ref{fusionleft} that the first two qubits can fuse to be either $\tau$ or
$\one$: denote these two possibilities by $((\tau,\tau)_\one,\tau)_\tau$ and
$((\tau,\tau)_\tau,\tau)_\tau$.

In $\Fib$, these are represented by eleemnts of $\Hom(\tau, ( (\tau \odot
\tau)\odot \tau)) \simeq \Hom(\tau, 2\tau \oplus \one) \simeq \mathbb{C}^2$. 
Define 

\begin{align}
\ket{0} = ((\tau,\tau)_\one , \tau)_\tau \\
\ket{1} = ((\tau,\tau)_\tau , \tau)_\tau 
\end{align}

$\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ are elements of $\Hom(\tau, ((\tau \odot \tau)\odot
\tau))$. We will call $\operatorname{span}\left\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1} \right\}$
the \emph{computational space}. There is also a \emph{noncomputational space}
spanned by $\ket{\text{NC}} = ( (\tau,\tau)_\tau,
\tau)_\one$. One of the principal issues with this simulation is that of
``leakage'': some operations take us out of the computational space. 

Performing measurements in the $\left\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1} \right\}$ basis is
straightforward: just fuse the first two anyons and measure the result, then
fuse the remaining two and measure again.

We have explained how 1-qubit systems are simulated. Multiqubit systems are
similar: for $n$ qubits, we take $n$ sets of $3$ anyons: $\tau^{\odot 3n}$.
For $\ket{\varphi},\ket{\psi}\in \Hom(\tau,(\tau \odot \tau) \odot \tau)$,
their tensor product $\ket{\varphi} \odot \ket{\psi} \in \Hom(\tau \odot
\tau, (\tau)^{\odot 6}) \simeq \mathbb{C}^{13}$. 

The vectors $\left\{ \ket{i}\odot \ket{j} : 0 \leq i,j\leq 1 \right\}$
therefore span a 4-dimensional subspace of $\Hom(\tau \odot \tau, (\tau)^{\odot
6}) \simeq \mathbb{C}^{13}$. We again refer to this space as the
\emph{computational space} $V$. As $n$ gets larger, more and more of the space
is the noncomputational space. 

We now turn to the problem of defining gates. $\Fib$ is braided, so for any $n$
and object $V$ in $\Fib$, $B_n$ acts on $\Hom(V, \tau^{\odot n})$ by
composition: 

\begin{equation}
f \mapsto \sigma \circ f
\end{equation}

This gives a representation of the braid group on the hom sets $\Hom(\one,
\tau^{\odot n})$. In fact, it turns out that this representation is unitary.
Braids therefore act unitarily on our qubits, and we will use them as our
quantum gates. How do these braids act? The generator $\sigma_1$ of $B_3$,

acts on $\Hom(\tau, ( (\tau \odot \tau) \odot \tau))$ via the unitary matrix

\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{\frac{-4\pi i}{5}} & 0 \\
0 & e^{\frac{-2\pi i}{5}}  \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

with respect to the basis $\left\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1} \right\}$. This can be
computed either using the ``universal $R$-matrix'' in \ref{section:braiding} or
by solving for it using the fusion rules and the axioms for a braided monoidal
category (see \cite{Panangaden}).

$\Hom(\tau, \tau^{\odot 3})$ also has the basis \{ $(\tau,
(\tau,\tau)_\one)_\tau$, $(\tau, (\tau,\tau)_\tau)_\tau$ \}. It is obtained
from the basis $\left\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1} \right\}$ by composing with the
associativity isomorphism $\alpha_{\tau,\tau,\tau}$. The change of basis matrix
is called the \emph{$F$-matrix}. It is

\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
\phi^{-1} & \sqrt(\phi^{-1}) \\
\sqrt(\phi^{-1}) & -\phi^{-1} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ is the golden ratio. The $F$-matrix is also unitary.

The $R$ and $F$-matrices allow us to compute the $2 \times 2$ matrix
corresponding to each element of $B_3$ in this representation: the other
generator $\sigma_2$ of $B_3$ acts as $F^{-1}RF$. In fact, the $R$ and $F$
matrices are enough to compute the matrix associated to any element of the
$B_n$ acting on $\Hom(\one, \tau^{\odot n})$ or $\Hom(\tau, \tau^{\odot n})$.
