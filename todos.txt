Introduction:
    - ask Prakash about writing some paragraphs about connecting MTCs to TQC
    - Rewrite some introductory sections (eg that of 4.3) after having an introduction
    - read Preskill for some inspiration

Algebraic background:
    - say something more (at all) about the braid group

Categorical background:
    - expand ribbon categories section do be better motivated
    - give some more motivation for ribbon categories: 
            "For ribbon-ness you should say that physical realizations of
            anyons are extended objects which can indeed be twisted."
    - reference Eric's stuff better


U_q(sl(2)):
    - give some references for quantum integers and q-calculus

MTC => TQC:
    - sketch the proof of universality
    - make sure you can do this R-matrix calculation

General:
    - Spellcheck.
    - Ask Prakash about making an index of notation
    - ask alex again about categorical references on Wednesday
    - find refs for q-integers and q-calculus
        Not sure about this. Did find the Swamy paper. not sure about Ernst paper

What does Fib have to do with SO(3)?
What is the Lie algebra of SO(3)? (you know...)

Internet:
- check if there's a different defn of Cartan subalgebra
    Yes. In general the definition is different
