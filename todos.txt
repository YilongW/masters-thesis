Introduction:
    - ask Prakash about writing some paragraphs about connecting MTCs to TQC
    - Rewrite some introductory sections (eg that of 4.3) after having an introduction
    - read Preskill for some inspiration

Algebraic background: 
    Lie Algebra stuff:
    - sketch the classification of Lie algebras
    - explain what a root system is 
    - introduce an inner product on roots without defining it.
    - say what a positive root is.
    - generally clean up the Lie algebra section
    - make sure the section on sl(2) relations well to 4.2

Categorical background:
    - introduce MTCs via Muger notes. Look for a reference (perhaps there is one in your notes).
      there is one here: http://www.math.ru.nl/~mueger/PDF/20.pdf
    - give some intuition for the dual and ribbon parts: take some inspiration from Eric?
    - reference Eric's stuff; it's pretty nice I think


U_q(sl(2)):
    - give some references for quantum integers and q-calculus

MTC => TQC:
    - sketch the proof of universality
    - make sure you can do this R-matrix calculation

General:
    - Spellcheck.
    - Ask Prakash about making an index of notation
