- collect what algebraic & categorical background to introduce. 
- write up bit about tr_q(f) = tr(kf)
Say somewhere that we're working over a field of characteristic 0.

Algebraic background: 
    - write a section about quantum algebra
    - write the modules & representations section
        define maximal submodule
    - braid group
    - sketch the classification of Lie algebras
    - talk about roots and weights?


Categorical background:
    - introduce MTCs via Muger notes. Look for a reference (perhaps there is one in your notes).
      there is one here: http://www.math.ru.nl/~mueger/PDF/20.pdf
    - talk about fusion some (source: Kassel?)
    - consider introducing graphical notation?

U_q(sl(2)):
    - Work out what V_n, the Verma modules are.  (the (V(n,_), I think))
    - find out if the V(n,-) are Weyl modules.
    - Find out what Weyl modules are, really. 
    - Find out what the R-matrix is
    - Clean up your notation. 
    - Extract some content from the Andersen & Paradowski paper (done! Via Sawin.)

    - talk about quantum Clebsch-Gordon (maybe this comes from [AP]?)

    - describe this quotient in some explicit way in the sl(2) case
        - describe the braiding morphisms explicitly 
    - define represenations of U_q(g)
    - Define the region $\Lambda^\ell$.

TQC:
    - Explain how to simulate circuit-based quantum computation in this
      quotient category (be really explicit about the braiding morphisms)
    - sketch the proof of universality

general structure:
- get thesis thing that Maja gave you up and running (seems useful!)
- get your equation numbering straight
- get your references in place. You're going to have to cite things soon
 put thesis backups somewhere
