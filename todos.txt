- collect what algebraic & categorical background to introduce. 

Algebraic background: 
    - Modules
    - braid group
    - Representations
    - define a simple Lie algebra
    - Ring quotients?

Categorical background:
    - introduce MTCs via Muger notes. Look for a reference (perhaps there is one in your notes).
        there is one here: http://www.math.ru.nl/~mueger/PDF/20.pdf
    - talk about fusion some (source: Kassel?)
U_q(sl(2)):
    - Work out what V_n, the Verma modules are. 
    - Clean up your notation. 
    - Extract some content from the Andersen & Paradowski paper
    - talk about quantum Clebsch-Gordon (maybe this comes from [AP]?)
    - describe this quotient in some explicit way in the sl(2) case
        - describe the braiding morphisms explicitly 

TQC:
    - Explain how to simulate circuit-based quantum computation in this quotient category (be really explicit about the braiding morphisms)
    - sketch the proof of universality

general structure:
- get thesis thing that Maja gave you up and running
- get your theorem and definition numbering more straight
- get your references in place. You're going to have to cite things soon
