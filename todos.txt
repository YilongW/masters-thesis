Algebraic background: 
    - write a section about quantum algebra
    - sketch the classification of Lie algebras
    - explain what a root system is 
    - introduce an inner product on roots without defining it.
    - say what a positive root is.
    - generally clean up the Lie algebra section

Categorical background:
    - introduce MTCs via Muger notes. Look for a reference (perhaps there is one in your notes).
      there is one here: http://www.math.ru.nl/~mueger/PDF/20.pdf
    - give some intuition for the dual and ribbon parts: take some inspiration from Eric?
    - reference Eric's stuff; it's pretty nice I think

MTC => TQC:
    - Explain how to simulate circuit-based quantum computation in this
      quotient category (be really explicit about the braiding morphisms)
    - sketch the proof of universality
    - basically do everything here =\
