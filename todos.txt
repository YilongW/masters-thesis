- write up bit about tr_q(f) = tr(kf) (write moar!)

Algebraic background: 
    - write a section about quantum algebra
    - braid group (??)
    - sketch the classification of Lie algebras
    - explain what a root system is 
    - introduce an inner product on roots without defining it.
    - say what a positive root is.

Categorical background:
    - introduce MTCs via Muger notes. Look for a reference (perhaps there is one in your notes).
      there is one here: http://www.math.ru.nl/~mueger/PDF/20.pdf
    - give some intuition for the dual

U_q(sl(2)):
    - ** talk about quantum Clebsch-Gordon (maybe this comes from [AP]?)
    - Define the region $\Lambda^\ell$.

TQC:
    - Explain how to simulate circuit-based quantum computation in this
      quotient category (be really explicit about the braiding morphisms)
    - sketch the proof of universality
