\todo{This could use some general improvement.}
Models of topological quantum computing arise from the representations of
certain Hopf algebras called quantum groups. There is no agreed-upon definition
for the term ``quantum group'': rather there are various classes of Hopf
algebras which are referred to as quantum groups. In particular quantum groups
are normally neither commutative nor cocommutative. The quantum groups we will
be interested in are the ``Drinfel'd-Jimbo type'' quantum groups introduced by
Drinfel'd and Jimbo \todo{find a reference}. They arise as deformations of the
universal enveloping algebra of a semisimple Lie algebra $\frakg$.

In this chapter we will define and describe in detail the representation theory
of the quantum group $U_q(\sll(2))$ at a root of unity, which is essential for
understanding the setting for topological quantum computing. We will also
discuss briefly the general case, an exposition of which can be found in
\cite{CP}.

\section{The quantum group $U_q(\sll(2))$}
\label{UqSL2}


The quantum group $U_q(\sll(2))$ is Hopf algebra which is a deformation of the
universal enveloping algebra $U(\sll(2))$ defined in \ref{example:UEA}.  In this
section we will define the algebra $U_q(\sll(2))$, explain its relationship to 
$U(\sll(2))$, and give the Hopf algebra structure on $U_q(\sll(2))$.

\begin{defn}
\label{Uqsl2Def}
Let $q$ be an indeterminate. $U_q(\sll(2))$ is the associative algebra over
$\mathbb{C}(q)$ with generators $X^+,X^-,K, K^{-1}$ and relations 

\begin{align}
    KK^{-1} &= 1 = K^{-1}K \\
    K X^+ K^{-1} &= q^2  X^+  \\
    KX^-K^{-1} &= q^{-2} X^- \\
    [ X^+ ,X^-] &= \frac{K - K^{-1}}{q - q^{-1}}
\end{align}
\end{defn}

In general $ X^+ $ and $X^-$ should be thought of as the analogs of $X$ and $Y$
in $U(\sll(2))$: in fact $X^+$ and $X^-$ act as raising and lowering operators
in representations of $U_q(\sll(2))$ the same way as $X,Y$ in $U(\sll(2))$. To
see the relationship between $U_q(\sll(2))$ and $U(\sll(2))$, we will make use
of an alternate presentation of $U_q(\sll(2))$.  Define $U'_q(\sll(2))$ to be
the associative algebra with generators $ X^+ ,X^-,L,K,K^{-1}$ and relations

\begin{align}
    KK^{-1} &= 1 &  K^{-1}K  &=1 \\
    KEK^{-1} &= q^2 E & KFK^{-1} &= q^{-2} F \\
    [E,F] &= L  & (q - q^{-1})L &= K-K^{-1} \\
    [L,E] &= q(EK + K^{-1}E) & [L,F] &= -q^{-1}(FK + K^{-1}F)
\end{align}

A calculation shows that $U_q(\sll(2)) \simeq U_q'(\sll(2)$. If we define the
algebra $U_1'(\sll(2))$ over $\mathbb{C}$ having the same generators and
relations as $U_q'(\sll(2))$ with $q$ replaced by 1, then it is easily seen
that $U_1'(\sll(2)) /(K-1) \simeq U(\sll(2))$ by sending $X^+ \mapsto X, X^-
\mapsto Y, L \mapsto H, K \mapsto 1$. This gives some  justification for
calling $U_q(\sll(2))$ a deformation of $U(\sll(2))$.

We can define a Hopf algebra structure on $U_q(\sll(2))$ as follows:

% from Kassel, p. 140
The comultiplication and counit are given by
\begin{align}
    \Delta(X^+) &= 1 \otimes  X^+  +  X^+  \otimes K &  \Delta(X^-) &= K^{-1} \otimes X^- + X^- \otimes 1 \\
    \Delta(K) &= K \otimes K &  \Delta(K^{-1}) &= K^{-1} \otimes K^{-1}\\ 
    \varepsilon( X^+ ) &= \varepsilon(X^-) = 0 &  \varepsilon(K) &= \varepsilon(K^{-1}) = 1
\end{align}

and the antipode by
\begin{align}
    S(X^+) &= - X^+ K^{-1} & S(X^-)      &= -KX^- \\
    S(K) &= K^{-1}   & S(K^{-1}) &= K 
\end{align}
It is straightforward to check that this defines a Hopf algebra structure. This
looks quite similar to the Hopf algebra structure on $U(\sll(2))$ defined in
\ref{example:UEA}, and in fact the isomorphism $U_1'(\sll(2)) /(K-1)
\simeq U(\sll(2))$ is an isomorphism of Hopf algebras.

\section{Representations of $U_q(\sll(2))$}
\label{section:RepsOfUq}

The representation theory of $U_q(\sll(2))$ bears a striking resemblance to
that of $\sll(2)$. In particular, in $U_q(\sll(2))$:

\begin{enumerate}
    \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\roman{enumi})}
    \item Every finite dimensional representation is completely reducible
    \item The eigenvectors of $K$ form a basis for any irreducible representations. We call the eigenvalues of $K$ \emph{weights}.
    \item Each irreducible representation has a highest weight vector
    \item The irreducible representations are classified by highest weights much as in $U(\sll(2))$.
\end{enumerate}

The proofs of these facts are also more or less analogous to those in
$U(\sll(2))$, though not always in a straightforward way. For proofs of i),
ii), see \cite{Kassel1994}. We will sketch the classification of the
irreducible representations of $U_q(\sll(2))$ here.


\begin{claim}
\label{claim:HighestWeight}
    Let $M$ be a finite dimensional $U_q(\sll(2))$-module. Then there is an
    eigenvector $v_0 \in M$ of $K$ such that $ X^+ v_0 = 0$. We call $v_0$ a
    \emph{highest weight vector}.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}

    Suppose not. Let $v$ be an eigenvector of $K$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$.
    $K X^+ = q^2  X^+ K$, so it follows that $(X^+)^i v$ is an
    eigenvector of $K$ with eigenvalue $q^{2i}\lambda$. Each value
    $q^{2i}\lambda$ is different, therefore $K$ has infinitely many
    eigenvectors. 

    This is impossible, so some $(X^+)^i v$ must be zero. Let $i$ be the
    smallest such, and choose $v_0 = (X^+)^{i-1} v$.
\end{proof}

We now have that any irreducible representation of $U_q$ is generated by a
highest weight vector. We can now show how to classify the irreducible
representations. 

For any $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}(q), \lambda \neq 0$ there is an infinite
dimensional $U_q(\sll(2))$-module $M(\lambda)$ called a \emph{Verma module}
with basis $v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots$ such that for any $i$,

\begin{align}
    Kv_i &= \lambda q^{n-2i}v_i \\
    X^-v_i &= v_{i+1} \\
     X^+ v_i &= \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if $i = 0$} \\
                          [i]_q \frac{\lambda q^{1-i} - \lambda^{-1}q^{i-1}}{q - q^{-1}}v_{i-1} & \text{else}
            \end{cases}
\end{align}

To see that this a $U_q(\sll(2))$-module, we can note that 

\begin{equation}
    M(\lambda) \simeq U_q(\sll(2))/(U_q(\sll(2)) X^+  + U_q(\sll(2))(K-\lambda))
\end{equation}

with $v_i$ being the coset of $(X^-)^i$. It follows from this that if $M$ is a
$U_q(\sll(2))$-module and $v \in M$ is such that $X^+ v = 0$ and $Kv = \lambda v$, there
is a unique homomorphism $\varphi: M(\lambda) \to M$ where $\varphi(v_0) = v$.
If $M$ is simple, then this homomorphism must be  surjective and it follows
that $M$ is a quotient of $M(\lambda)$. 

We now have that 
\begin{claim}
    Any finite dimensional simple $U_q(\sll(2))$-module is a quotient of $M(\lambda)$.
\end{claim}

\begin{claim}
    $M(\lambda)$ is simple for $\lambda \neq \pm q^n$
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
    See \cite{Jantzen1995}.
\end{proof}

For $\lambda = \pm q^{n}$, $M(\lambda)$ has one nontrivial submodule spanned by the $v_i$ with $i \geq n+1$.
This leads us to the following characterization (details can be found in \cite{Jantzen1995}):


For each integer $n \geq 0$, there are two unique (up to isomorphism)
representations of $U_q(\sll(2))$ of dimension $n+1$. 
The representations are $V_q(n)$ with basis $\left\{ v^+_0, \ldots, v^+_n
\right\}$, and $V_q^-(n)$ with basis $\left\{ v^-_0, \ldots, v^-_n \right\}$
with action defined by 

% from Kassel, p. 101
\begin{align*}
    &K v^+_i = q^{n-2i} v^+_i  &
    &K v^-_i = -q^{n-2i} v^-_i \\
    &X^- v^+_i = \begin{cases} [i+1]_qv_{i+1}& \text{ if $i < n$} \\ 0& \text{ if $i = n$} \end{cases} &
    &X^- v^-_i = \begin{cases} [i+1]_qv'_{i+1}& \text{ if $i < n$} \\ 0& \text{ if $i = n$} \end{cases} \\
    & X^+  v^+_i = \begin{cases} 
                     [n-i+1]_qv_{i-1}& \text{ if $i > 0$} \\ 
                    0& \text{ if $i = 0$} 
             \end{cases} &
    & X^+  v^-_i = \begin{cases} 
                    -[n-i+1]_q v'_{i-1}& \text{ if $i > 0$} \\ 
                    0& \text{ if $i = 0$} 
             \end{cases}
\end{align*}

By the proof sketched above, these are the only representations of
$U_q(\sll(2))$.  Note that the representations $V_q^-(n)$ can be obtained by
$V_q(n)$ by tensoring with the one-dimensional representation $V_q^-(0)$:
essentially the difference from $U(\sll(2))$ here is that there are 2
nonisomorphic 1-dimensional representations. We can (and will) therefore
restrict our attention to the representations $V_q(n)$.

\section{Setting $q$ to be a root of unity}

We are interested in constructing modular tensor categories from quantum groups at roots of unity. In this section, we explain how to set the indeterminate $q$ to be a complex root of unity in $U_q(\sll(2))$. There are 2 different ways to set $q$ to be a complex number $z$, which result in different algebras when $z$ is a root of unity. 

The first and most obvious way is, for any $z \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $z ^2
\neq 0,1$, to set $q = z$ in the definition (\ref{Uqsl2Def}) of $U_q(\sll(2)$.
Denote the algebra obtained in this way by $U_z(\sll(2))$. This algebra is of
interest in its own right when $z$ is a root of unity (\cite{Jantzen1995}
discusses it in detail), but does not lead us to a modular tensor category.

The second way is to let $\mathcal{A} = \mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]$ and define a
`restricted' $\mathcal{A}$-subalgebra $U_\mathcal{A}^{res}(\sll(2))$ to be the
$\mathcal{A}$-subalgebra of $U_q(\sll(2))$ generated by $ X^+$
,$X^-$,$K$,$K^{-1}$, $(X^+) ^{(n)}$, $(X^-)^{(n)}$, where


\begin{align}
     (X^+)^{(n)} = \frac{ (X^+)^n}{[n]^!_{q}} \\
    (X^-)^{(n)} = \frac{(X^-)^n}{[n]^!_{q}} 
\end{align}


Define 
\begin{equation}
    U_z^{res}(\sll(2)) = U_\mathcal{A}^{res}(\sll(2)) \otimes_A \mathbb{Q}(z)
\end{equation}

This is the algebra whose representations we will be interested in.  If $z$ is
not a root of unity, then $U_z^{res}(\sll(2)) \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}(z)}
\mathbb{C}$ and $U_z(\sll(2))$ are isomorphic. When $z$ is an $\ell^{th}$ root
of unity, $\ell \geq 3$,

\begin{lemma}
    In $U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$, $ (X^+)^\ell = (X^-)^\ell = 0$ for all $i$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    $ (X^+)^\ell = [\ell]_{q}^!  (X^+)^{(\ell)} = 0$ as $[\ell]_{q}^! = 0$. Similarly for $(X^-)^\ell$.
\end{proof}

$(X^+)^\ell \neq 0$ in $U_z(\sll(2))$, so it is clear that these algebras are
not isomorphic when $q$ is a root of unity. The representation theory of
$U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$, discussed in the next section, will give us modular
tensor categories and therefore models of topological quantum computing.

\section{The Representation theory of $U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$}
\label{section:RepTheoryofResSL2}


Throughout this section $z$ will be assumed to be an $\ell^{th}$ root of unity, where $\ell \geq 3$ is odd.

The objects of the MTC we are interested in are irreducible representations of
$U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$. Unlike in the case of $U_q(\sll(2))$, not every
representation of $U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$ is completely reducible, and in general
the representation theory is quite complicated. To get an idea of why this is
the case, note that the argument in \ref{claim:HighestWeight} for why every
representation has a highest weight breaks down when $q=z$ is a root of unity.
However, the modular tensor category we wish to construct comes from a
subcategory of the category of reps, so it will be enough to understand a
limited subset of the representations. The most important representations for
us to understand are the \emph{Weyl modules}, which we will define in this
section. 

Define a representation of $U_z^{res}$ to be of \emph{type $\mathbf{1}$} if
$K^\ell = 1$. As in $U_q(\sll(2))$, any representation of $U_z^{res}$ is
isomorphic to the tensor product of a representation of type $\mathbf{1}$ with
a one-dimensional representation. We can therefore restrict our attention to
representations of type $\mathbf{1}$. 

Recall that in $U_q(\sll(2))$ the irreducible representations $V_q(n)$ are
indexed by integers $n \geq 0$. We will use these representations to define
representations of $U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$ as follows.

Let $V_q(n)$ be the irreducible $U_q(\sll(2))$-module defined in section
\ref{section:RepsOfUq}.  Let $V_\mathcal{A}^{res}(n)$ be the
$U_\mathcal{A}^{res}$-submodule of $V_q(n)$ generated by $v_0$, and define the
\emph{Weyl module}

\begin{equation}
    W_z^{res}(n) = V_\mathcal{A}^{res}(n) \otimes_\mathcal{A} \mathbb{C}
\end{equation}


More concretly, the Weyl module $W_z^{res}(n)$ has basis $\{v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n\}$, where
\begin{align}
    X^+ v_i &= [n-i+1]_z v_{i-1} \\
    (X^+)^{(\ell)} v_i &= ( (n-i)_1) + 1) v_{i-\ell} \\
    (X^-)^{(\ell)} v_i &= ( i_1 + 1) v_{i+\ell} \\
    X^-v_i &= [i+1]_z v_{i+1} \\
    Kv_i &= z^{n-2i} v_i \\
\end{align}

where for any integer $r$, $r_0,r_1$ are defined such that $r = r_0 + \ell r_1$
and $0 \leq r_0 < \ell$. 

\begin{claim} $W_z^{res}(n)$ is irreducible if and only if $n < \ell$ or $\ell \mid (n+1)$
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
See \cite{CP}
\end{proof}

In the case that $W_z^{res}$ is not irreducible, it is not difficult to prove the following proposition:

\begin{prop}
Let $V'$ be the subspace of $W_z^{res}(n)$ spanned by the $v_r$ such that $n_0 < r_0 < \ell$ and $r_1 < m_1$
\begin{enumerate}
    \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\roman{enumi})}
    \item $V'$ is the only proper $U_z^{res}$-submodule of $W_z^{res}(n)$
    \item $V' \simeq V_z^{res}(m)$, where $m = \ell - 2 - n_0 + \ell(n_1 - 1)$
    \item $W_z^{res}(n) / V'$ is irreducible
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

It follows that each $W_z^{res}(n)$ has a unique irreducible quotient module $V_z^{res}(n) = W_z^{res}(n) / V'$. 

The proofs of the following two theorems about the structure of irreducible reps of $U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$ can be found in \cite{CP}.
\begin{theorem}
Every finite-dimensional irreducible $U_z^{res}$-module of type $\mathbf{1}$ is isomorphic to some $V_z^{res}(n)$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
$V_z^{res}(n) \simeq V_z^{res}(n_0) \otimes V_{z}^{res}(\ell n_1)$
\end{theorem}

\section{A braiding for $U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$}
\label{section:braiding}

To construct a MTC from the representations of $U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$, we need a
braiding as defined in \ref{section:Braiding}.  In this section we will give a
braiding $\sigma_{V,W}: V \otimes W \to W \otimes V$ for representations $V,W$
of $U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$ which are the direct sums of their weight spaces.
Throughout $V,W$ will be assumed to be such modules. This braiding does not
come from a universal $R$-matrix for $U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$ as discussed in
\ref{subsection:R-matrix}, but is derived from a universal $R$-matrix for a
larger algebra. Details of this construction can be found in \cite{CP}.


Define 

\begin{equation}
\tilde{R}_q = \sum_{t=0}^\infty q^{\frac{1}{2} t(t+1)} \frac{(1-q^{-2})^t}{[t]_q^{!}} ((X^+)^t \otimes (X^-)^t)
\end{equation}

This will be our ``universal $R$-matrix''. Of course, this is not an element of
$U_z^{res}(\sll(2)) \otimes U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$ as the sum is infinite; it lies in a
completion of $U_z^{res}(\sll(2)) \otimes U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$. However, each of the terms
in the sum is an element of $U_z^{res}(\sll(2)) \otimes U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$, and for any
irreducible finite dimensional representations $\rho_V : U_z^{res}(\sll(2)) \to
\End(V)$, $\rho_W : U_z^{res}(\sll(2)) \to \End(W)$, all but finitely many terms in the
sum act as zero on $V \otimes W$. In other words, $\rho_V \otimes \rho_W
(\tilde{R}_q) \in \End(V \otimes W)$. This will allow us to construct a
braiding.


Define an invertible operator $E_{V,W}$ on $V \otimes W$ which acts as
$\lambda\overline{\mu}$ on the weight subspace $V^\lambda \otimes W^\mu$. As remarked
earlier, $\rho_V \otimes \rho_W (\tilde{R}_q) $ is a well-defined element of
$\End(V \otimes W)$. Let 

\begin{equation}
R_{V,W} = E_{V,W} \rho_V \otimes \rho_W (\tilde{R}_q)
\end{equation}

\begin{claim}
For any $x \in U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$, $V,W$ irreducible representations of $U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$
\begin{enumerate}
\item $R_{V,W} (\rho_V \otimes \rho_W) (\Delta(x)) R^{-1}_{V,W} = (\rho_{V} \otimes \rho_W)(\Delta^{op}(x))$
\item $R_{V,W}$  satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation: 

\begin{equation}
R_{12} R_{13} R_{23} = R_{23} R_{13} R_{12}
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
    See \cite{CP}.
\end{proof}

We have therefore that 

\begin{theorem}
The category of finite dimensional $U_z^{res}(\sll(2))$-modules of type
$\mathbf{1}$ which are the direct sums of their weight spaces is a braided
monoidal category, with braiding isomorphisms given by 

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{V,W}(v \otimes w) = R_{V,W}(w \otimes v)
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}


\section{$U_q(\frakg)$}
\label{U_q(g)}

    % taken from Jantzen

    Let $\frakg$ be an arbitrary semisimple algebra. Suppose $\Pi$ is
    a basis of the root system, and denote the entries of the Cartan matrix
    by 

    \begin{equation}
        a_{\alpha\beta} = 2(\alpha, \beta) / (\alpha, \alpha).
    \end{equation}

    Then the Lie algebra has a presentation with $3|\Pi|$ generators
    $x_\alpha, y_\alpha, h_\alpha$, $\alpha \in \Pi$ and the relations 

    \begin{align}
        \left[ h_\alpha, h_\beta \right] &= 0       &   \left[ x_\alpha, y_\beta \right] &= \delta_{\alpha\beta} h_\alpha \\
        \left[ h_\alpha, x_\beta \right] &= a_{\alpha\beta} x_\beta  &   \left[ h_\alpha, y_\beta \right] &= -a_{\alpha\beta} y_\beta \\
    \end{align}

    Set

    \begin{equation}
        q_\alpha = q^{d_\alpha}
    \end{equation}

    and for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$,

    \begin{equation}
        [n]_\alpha = [n]_{q_\alpha} = \frac{q^{nd_\alpha} - q^{-nd_\alpha}}{q^{d_\alpha} - q^{-d_\alpha}}
    \end{equation}

    $[n]_\alpha^!$ and $\dbinom{n}{k}_\alpha$ are defined similarly: 
    
    \begin{equation}
        [n]_\alpha^! = [n]_{q_{\alpha}}^!
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \dbinom{n}{k}_\alpha = \dbinom{n}{k}_{q_\alpha}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{defn}
    \label{UqgDef}
        The quantum group $U_q(\frakg)$ has generators
        $ X^+ _\alpha, X^-_\alpha, K_\alpha, K_\alpha^{-1}$ for each $\alpha \in
        \Pi$, and relations

        \begin{align}
            K_\alpha K_\alpha^{-1} =\ &1  = K_\alpha^{-1}K_\alpha \\
            K_\alpha K_\beta &= K_\beta K_\alpha \\
            K_\alpha  X^+ _\beta K_\alpha^{-1} &= q^{(\alpha, \beta)}  X^+ _\beta \\
            K_\alpha X^-_\beta K_\alpha^{-1} &= q^{-(\alpha, \beta)}  X^+ _\beta \\
            [ X^+ _\alpha, X^-_\beta] &= \delta_{\alpha\beta} \frac{K_\alpha - K_\alpha^{-1}}{ q_\alpha - q_\alpha^{-1}} 
        \end{align}

        for all $\alpha, \beta \in \Pi$, and for $a \neq \beta$

        \begin{align}
            \sum_{s=0}^{1-a_{\alpha\beta}} (-1)^s \dbinom{1-a_{\alpha\beta}}{s}_\alpha  (X^+)_\alpha^{1-a_{\alpha\beta} - s}  X^+_\beta  (X^+)_\alpha^s  &= 0 \\
            \sum_{s=0}^{1-a_{\alpha\beta}} (-1)^s \dbinom{1-a_{\alpha\beta}}{s}_\alpha (X^-)_\alpha^{1-a_{\alpha\beta} - s} (X^-)_\beta (X^-)_\alpha^s  &= 0 
        \end{align}
    \end{defn}

We can define a Hopf algebra structure $(\Delta, \varepsilon, S)$ such
that for all $\alpha \in \Pi$,

    \begin{align}
        \Delta( X^+ _\alpha) &=  X^+ _\alpha \otimes 1 + K_\alpha \otimes  X^+ _\alpha      & \varepsilon( X^+ _\alpha) &= 0  & S( X^+ _\alpha) &= -K_\alpha^{-1}  X^+ _\alpha \\
        \Delta(X^-_\alpha) &= X^-_\alpha \otimes K_\alpha^{-1} + 1 \otimes X^-_\alpha & \varepsilon(X^-_\alpha) &= 0  & S(X^-_\alpha) &= -X^-_\alpha K_\alpha \\
        \Delta(K_\alpha) &= K_\alpha \otimes K_\alpha                           & \varepsilon(K_\alpha) &= 1  & S(K_\alpha) &= K_\alpha^{-1}
    \end{align}


\subsection{The representation theory of $U_z^{res}(\frakg)$}

Recall that for $U_q(\frakg)$ the irreducible representations $V_q(\lambda)$
were indexed by highest weights $\lambda$. We can use these representations to
define representations of $U_z^{res}(\frakg)$ as follows:

\todo{explain about weights, $v_\lambda$}

Let $V_q(\lambda)$ be the irreducible $U_q(\frakg)$-module with highest weight
$\lambda$. Let $V_\mathcal{A}^{res}(\lambda)$ be the
$U_\mathcal{A}^{res}(g)$-submodule of $V_q(\lambda)$ generated by $v_\lambda$,
and define the \emph{Weyl module}

\begin{equation}
    W_z^{res}(\lambda) = V_\mathcal{A}^{res}(\lambda) \otimes_\mathcal{A} \mathbb{C}
\end{equation}

via the homomorphism $A \to \mathbb{C}$, $q \mapsto z$.

\begin{claim}
    $W_z^{res}(\lambda)$ is irreducible if either 
    \begin{enumerate}
